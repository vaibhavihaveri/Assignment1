console.log(1+"2"+"2");
output:122
Because:it acts as an concatenation operator so results as 122.

console.log(1+ +"2"+"2");
output:32
Because:1+ +"2" acts as an integer so results as 1+2= 3 and +"2" is concatenation 
        operator it results as 32 we get output as 32.

console.log(1+ -"1"+"2");
output:02
Because:1+ -1 acts as  integer so results as 1-1= 0 and +"2" is concatenation 
        operator it results as 02 we get output as 02.



console.log("A"-"B"+"2");
output:NaN2
Because:if you are trying to use any operator expect "+"on string then it will
        display"NaN" and +"2" concate with NaN and results as NaN2.

console.log("A"-"B"+2);
output:NaN
Because:if you are trying to use any operator expect "+"on string then it will
        display"NaN".
